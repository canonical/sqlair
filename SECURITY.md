# Security policy

## Supported versions

SQLair is still under development and as such only the latest version is
supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please provide a description of the issue, the steps you took to
create the issue, affected versions, and, if known, mitigations for
the issue.

The preferred way to report a security issue is through
[GitHub's security advisory for this project](https://github.com/canonical/sqlair/security/advisories/new). See
[Privately reporting a security
vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
for instructions on reporting using GitHub's security advisory feature.

The [Ubuntu Security disclosure and embargo
policy](https://ubuntu.com/security/disclosure-policy) contains more information
about how you can contact us, what you can expect when you contact us, and what
we expect from you.
