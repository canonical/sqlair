# Use custom types in structs
SQLair makes it very easy to serialise to and from structs. But one case that may cause issues, is when you have a user defined type in your struct. For example:
```go
type MyModel struct {
  ID  int    `db:"uuid"`
  Key *MyKey `db:"key"`
}

type MyKey [32]int
```
For this example, `MyKey` could be any use defined type that can be serialised to a database row type. The problem is, that SQLair and its underlying libraries do not know how to serialise the `MyKey` type.

Luckily, there are two very useful interfaces you can use to get around this problem. The [Valuer](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql/driver#Valuer) and [Scanner](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#Scanner). The `Valuer` interface tells the driver how to serialise the type for putting in the database and the Scanner tells it how to deserialise it.

For example:
```go
func (k *MyKey) Value() (driver.Value, error) {
  return k[:], nil
}

func (k *MyKey) Scan(src any) error {
  bs, ok := src.([]byte)
  if !ok {
    return fmt.Errorf("unexpected type %T", src)
  }
  if len(bs) != len(k) {
    return fmt.Errorf("invalid key found in db")
  }
  copy(k[:], bs) 
  return nil
}
```

See the [Valuer](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql/driver#Valuer) and [Scanner](https://pkg.go.dev/database/sql#Scanner) interface documentation for more details.
